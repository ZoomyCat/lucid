Mindmapping Documentation
=====

Who is mindmapping for?
=====
Anyone that needs a productive process geared towards visually organizing thoughts, ideas and information.

Why do you mindmap?
=====
I mindmap primarily as a means to organize my thoughts in a coherant and understandable manner. It allows me to process information in many different ways visually. Mapping out how an idea or workflow processes now is useful in order to plan future iterations.

What is a .mup file?
=====
.mup files are the files saved by [mindmup](https://www.mindmup.com/).

When can I get started mindmapping?
=====
You can start mindmapping right now if you want!

How do I get started?
=====
I use a website called [mindmup](https://www.mindmup.com/) to do my mindmapping. It is a web-based application so will operate in an entirely cross platform environment.

If you downloaded the git repository and were poking around the documentation and found some *.mup files then those are likely mindmaps creating during the development process to either help the developers understand or relay information efficiently.

They are probably important little tidbits of information in order to gain understanding upon the entire project.
