Lucid OS Bugtracker
=====

This is the documentation on the Lucid OS Bugtracker and how to
effectively use the bugtracker.

Warning: It is important to follow the workflow in this documentation
    because I do not know how to fix if you put something in the wrong
    place. I do however know how to delete what people did that screwed
    up future workflow. Following the guidelines laid out here will
    ensure work that you do on the bug tracker is not simply deleted,
    I do not want anyones time wasted so please follow these guidelines.
