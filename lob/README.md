[Lucid OS Bugtracker](http://lob.celps.org)
=====

This is the documentation on the Lucid OS Bugtracker and how to
effectively use the bugtracker.

It is important to follow the workflow in this documentation because I
do not know how to fix if you put something in the wrong place. I do
however know how to delete items that conflict with future design
workflow. Following the guidelines laid out here will ensure work that
you do on the bug tracker is useful.

Everything is done in a modular way. In how we do nearly everything
even if we do not use modular packages yet. If branching something out
makes the larger picture easier understand then that is how it should
be done. We should create a new project if we are using a different git
repository so that no matter where you go things are at the very least
similar and understandable.

Lucid OS

Lucid OS is for larger tasks related to subtasks only. These are
"Larger Picture" items that are useful to gain a bigger image of a
lot of smaller tasks within another of the projects.

The versioning of Lucid OS goes according to how far along in the
development process we are at. As the capability of our tools are able
to increase the versioning of Lucid OS will increase to reflect the
point we are at in development.
