Lucid OS Repository

This is where all the PKGBUILDS and custom programs will reside for the Lucid OS Linux distribution.

Lucid OS will be an independent Linux distribution that uses tools from both Arch Linux and Manjaro. We follow the kiss principle from multiple perspectives. Having a system that is equally easy for the developer as it is the user is important and this is our goal.

We are currently in the early development stages.
