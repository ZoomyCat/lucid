Lucid OS Repository

--- We are currently in the early development stages. ---

This is where all the PKGBUILDS and tools will reside for the Lucid OS Linux distribution.

Lucid OS will be an independent Linux distribution that uses tools primarily from both Arch Linux and Manjaro.

We follow the kiss principle from not only one but multiple perspectives. Having a system that is equally as easy for the developer as it is the user is an important aspect of the kiss principle and this is our goal.

The official Lucid OS builds will be built with ease of use, functionality, productivity and quality in mind.

Only working repositories of PKGBUILDS get synced into master, If you're wondering about our current development then check out the merged-repo branch.

If you are wondering how our development team uses git then check out the [doc branch](https://github.com/edge226/lucid/tree/doc). Which will eventually contain much more documentation on various aspects of the project.
