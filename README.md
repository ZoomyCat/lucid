## Lucid Roadmap.

### Why change things?
With me using GitHub to host my website it becomes almost required to split things off into many repositories. I guess this goes in line with making things as modular as possible.


### Here is what I am planning on doing with this lucid repository.

* Splitting sources away from the main repository.
* Moving the PKGBUILD repositories into their own repository.
* Moving all documentation into the appropriate places with a corresponding website.

### What this means in terms I can understand.
This repository will continue to exist after it is modularized into seperate sections for learning purposes. Development will Continue on the split repositories.
