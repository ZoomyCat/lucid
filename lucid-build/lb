Name: 				lucid-build
  
Description:    	lucid-build compiles all PKGBUILD's recursively 
					within the working directory. It has options to
					modify where it starts searching and what
					architecture you would like to build within that
					working directory.
					
					Currently you can only use one architecture at
					a time but that will change.

Usage:				lucid-build (Options) [-d] <location>

Options: 		

	-h or --help 	You're reading it.
	
	-6				Compiles x86_64 packages.
	
	-3				Compiles i686 packages.
	
	-m				Compiles multilib packages.
					
	-d				Specifies the directory to start searching for
					PKGBUILD files.
Examples:		
	The following examples will compile packages for the appropriate 
	architecture starting in the current working directory.
	
	lb -6
	lb -3
	lb -m
	
	The following examples will compile packages for the appropriate
	architecture at the location you point it at.
	
	lb -6d /var/abs/core/pacman
	lb -3d /var/abs/core/pacman
	lb -md /var/abs/multilib/zsnes"
