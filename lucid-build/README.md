This build tool interfaces with devtools. It is complete awesomeness.

lb interfaces with lucid-build, Do not try to interface with lucid-build directly.
Put them both in /usr/local/bin.

If you get odd permissions issues make sure the files have executable properties by running chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/l*.

Check the help for usage and run as desired. The command is written for developers in mind so is as short as possible to get what you need done.
