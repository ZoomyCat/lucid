Lucid-Build
=====

lb, Lucid-Build and the associated git branch was depreciated when I started building lbf, lbf is essentially the evolution of the lb framework.

lb was capable of building an entire repository recursively and check the link status of the programs to be built. It was not modular enough and that is why I refactored it into lbf.
