## cleanbuildroot will create or clean the build root. It interfaces with
## parts of devtools in order to remove and recreate a fresh build
## root. Normally this is not needed but is neccessary if we point to a
## different repository. For instance switching from arch repositories
## into using a local repository to do the builds.
