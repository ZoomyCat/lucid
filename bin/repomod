	### Copying this before $pkg makes sure all debug files have been moved to the correct place.
	#mv *debug* "$repologdir"
	### This does contain some tar files so I copy it before $pkg. This leaves only $pkg and $src info left
	#mv *.log "$repologdir"
	#mv *"$buildarch$pkgext" "$repopkgdir" ## Copy the pkg into the repo.
    #mv *"multilib$pkgext" "$repopkgdir" ## Copy multilib packages into the repo, make sure to use -m through lb.
    #mv *"any$pkgext" "$repopkgdir" ## Copy any files for all architectures were compiled move them into the repo.
    #mv *.tar.* "$reposrcdir" ## Copy all remaining tarballs into the src directory.
