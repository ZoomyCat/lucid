lucid-devtools will be a modified version of the arch devtools compared and mixed in what makes sense from the manjaro devtools.

When this tool is ready to be used I plan on incorporating lucid-build into lucid-devtools to be used directly. Where the lucid-build branch is used for testing and encorporating new features.

This ensures that the development tools we provide have been thoroughly tested before being placed in a live environment.

The implementation of devtools we are currently using are the unmodified arch devtools. This comes with some caveats because their development model is different than ours so we need to modify and strip it works in the way we need.
